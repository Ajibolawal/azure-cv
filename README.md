## Front-End Development ðŸŽ¨

For the front-end of this project, I opted to leverage a pre-existing template from [CeeVee Templates](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/). This allowed me to focus on customising the content and functionality rather than building the entire structure from scratch.

I adapted the HTML code to suit my specific requirements and personal brand. This involved updating the information, modifying the layout, and integrating the visitor counter feature.

While the foundation was provided by the template, the final result reflects my own personal touch and showcases my skills and experience in a way that is unique to me. âœ¨

It's worth noting that the primary focus of this project isn't to demonstrate my front-end development skills with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Instead, it's about showcasing my ability to leverage cloud technologies to create a dynamic and engaging online CV.

The visitor counter itself is implemented using JavaScript, which fetches the visitor count from an Azure Function and updates the webpage to display it. This ensures the count is accurate and dynamically updated every time someone views the page.
